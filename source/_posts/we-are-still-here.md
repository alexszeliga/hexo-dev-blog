So I listened to Wall of Eyes by Radiohead. I guess it was some kind of trick to confuse the press? They released it under some other name. Anyway, it's a journey of how one would write a song if you had Thom Yorke's voice at your disposal. It was really good, and it ended with a lilting Thom Yorke piano ballad. No notes, Radiohead.

J Mascis new album What Do We Do Now was very comfortable for a sometimes Dinosaur Jr lover. It had what you've come to appreciate from J's solo work: dynamics. It lacks the obfuscation and complexity of a Dinosaur Jr. album, but it was very easy to listen to.
